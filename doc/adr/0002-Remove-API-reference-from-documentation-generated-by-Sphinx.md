# 2. Remove api reference from documentation generated by sphinx

Date: 2021-08-08

## Status

Accepted

## Context

Several Python packages are tried to include API reference
in documentation generated by Sphinx:

- [breathe](https://breathe.readthedocs.io/)
  - Hard to make easy to see API reference with many classes.
- [exhale](https://exhale.readthedocs.io/)
  - Didn't work with some template classes and overloaded functions in this project.

## Decision

I gave up to include API reference in documentation generated by Sphinx.
Instead of it, I put a link to API reference generated by Doxygen
in documentation generated by Sphinx.

## Consequences

API reference is successfully generated by Doxygen,
but documentation generated by Sphinx cannot have
links to contents (namespaces, classes, functions, ...) of API reference.

Note that I tried
[sphinxcontrib-doxylink](https://pythonhosted.org/sphinxcontrib-doxylink/)
and it didn't work too.
