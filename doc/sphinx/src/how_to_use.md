# How to Use

TODO: Packaging with vcpkg.

## Simply Including Headers

This library is header-only,
so you can simply include headers
setting `include` directory to an include directory of compilers.
Note that you must install additional dependencies,
which are installed automatically when using vcpkg:

- [fmt](https://fmt.dev/)
- [Eigen](https://eigen.tuxfamily.org/index.php?title=Main_Page)
- [cpp-hash-tables](https://gitlab.com/MusicScience37Projects/utility-libraries/cpp-hash-tables)
- [toml++](https://marzer.github.io/tomlplusplus/)
